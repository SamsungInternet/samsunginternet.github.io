      <h3>1. Purpose</h3>

      <p>This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our conference community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>
      <p>We invite all those who participate in Create to help us make the experience safe and positive everyone.</p>
      <h3>2. Encouraging and Recognizing Participation</h3>
      <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase meaningful collaboration by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our conference community.</p>
      <p>Intentional, positive action is essential to avoid replicating within our conference community the many forms of inequality that exist in greater society. For this reason, we outline in this Code of Conduct expected behavior as well as prohibited behavior.</p>
      <p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our conference community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, recognize them for their good work either personally or by letting conference organizers know.</p>

      <h3>5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
      <p>Unacceptable behavior from any conference community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>
      <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
      <p>If a conference community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the conference community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>
      <h3>6. Reporting Guidelines</h3>
      <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify one of the points of contact, Dan Appelquist (d.appelquist@samsung.com) or Ada Cannon (ada.cannon@samsung.com) or speak to a member of the event team.</p>
      <p>Additionally, conference organizers are available to help conference community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. Organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.</p>

      <p>This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of conference community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of conference community members.</p>
