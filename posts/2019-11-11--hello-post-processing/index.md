# Hello Post Processing!

Enhancing rendering fidelity for immersive applications

*Editor’s note: This post welcomes to the Samsung Internet Developer Advocacy team. Yannis will be building prototypes and proofs-of-concept using immersive web technology. We’re excited to have Yannis on board with us! -[Daniel Appelquist](undefined)*

When building an immersive application, on the web or otherwise, we can enhance the fidelity of our rendering by applying post processing effects.

The process is simple conceptually. We start by redirecting the rendering of scene objects into a texture, instead of directly on the screen for viewing.

![Original scene color](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3806/1*oLn6Mwb7_v_hd69-gVZ7jg.png)*Original scene color*

We then apply filters on the base rendering as if it was a photo. All kinds of blurs are among the most popular filters and form the basis for several effects.

As an example, we can just add the blurred version to the original color and output to screen to get a nice glow/bloom effect. This is a well known trick in the world of graphic design and cheap enough to apply in real time.

The rendering of the original scene does not result only in a texture with color information. We also get another grayscale texture, the depth map, for free.

While drawing, the rendering system automatically keeps reference of the depth/distances of drawn pixels from the camera. If new pixels are overlapping older but are further away they are discarded, saving the overhead it would take for the system to calculate their color.

This is a fundamental optimisation in 3D graphics and even though the depth map is just a by product, it turns out to be very useful in post processing.

For instance, by mixing the blurred image with the original according to the depth of the rendering we can achieve a focusing or depth-of-field effect.

The depth map enables a variety of effects that highlight volume in a scene, like outlines and ambient occlusion. We will deal with all these in next posts.

The images for this post were produced using three-effects, our home brew framework for developing applications using the popular [Three.js library](https://threejs.org/).

Three-effects comes with several builtin effects and we’ll get to see hands on each one of them in the next posts. For now, you can [check the code for this post’s demo](https://samsunginter.net/three-effects/examples/basic/) and find out more about the framework in [the github repo](https://github.com/SamsungInternet/three-effects).
