*Samsung Internet Beta gives you early access to the newest features of our secure, private and optimized mobile web…*play.google.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.sbrowser.beta&hl=en_GB)

As devices get bigger an important element of designing for user experience is to move many interactive elements to the bottom of the screen, keeping them in easy reach. This is a core tenet of Samsung’s OneUI design.

This is why the customisable menu bar is at the bottom of the screen in Samsung Internet. Allowing you to keep your most used actions an easy tap away. A lot of the new usability features in recent versions of Samsung Internet come from our focus on customisation, allowing you to optimise for your way of using the browser.

Samsung Internet 11.2 continues our trend of giving you more power to make the browser your own. We’ve added useful new buttons you can add to the menu or to the menu bar, such as:

* New Tab Button

* Quick enter ‘Secret Mode’

* Quick Exit, with optional clear all History & Cookies.

* Temporarily disable Ad-Blockers

* Search, let you focus on the address bar without needing to change hand position.

I’ve attached a screenshot of my own menu bar below, as well as the standard forward, back and home, I have added quick sharing , the “add to” button and the new “new tab” button.

You can find the settings for this in **Settings → Appearance → Customise Menu**.

### New Privacy and security features

This new feature called ‘Block unwanted webpages’ is designed to stop malicious websites who prevent you from leaving by silently inserting spam pages in your history before your actual navigation so that when you try to go back you see the spam page.

This may change your browsing experience (hopefully for the better) so by default it is off. It can be turned on under ‘Security and Privacy’ in settings.

Like our smart anti-tracking and warning about malicious sites, this is one more way Samsung Internet keeps you safe on the web.

### Smart anti-tracking has gotten smarter

We have improved the on-device machine learning model, that can detect and block the tracking cookies much earlier. We new catch double the tracking domains we caught before!

### New Option to block links which try to open apps

For example, Previously if you used the browser version of YouTube for the features provided by the browser such as Ad-Blocking, you may find the website kept launching the YouTube app instead.

You can now prevent the Web Pages from opening apps like in this situation, allowing you to keep using websites from the safety of the Web Browser.
